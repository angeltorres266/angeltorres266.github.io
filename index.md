## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 1

    Lab one was one of my favorite labs since it was the start of everything for me. It was a super simple code but it was fun to do. The hello wrld code began it all. I had never actually coded anything before so starting for the first time was pretty fun to do.

*Lab 6

    This Lab was super fun to do since we had to make a sandwich. It was silly to me because it's a code about ordering a sandwich and what you want on your sandwich. It was also made specifically to only have certain things too and could tell if it was a sandwich or not.

*Lab12

    This lab is one of my most hated but it's what makes me like it, since its the hardest lab ive attempted to do it took me forever to actually make it work as well as pass the tests. I was paired up with someone who knew a lot more about coding than me and even he was having some trouble whenever it was his turn. It took us forever but the challenge is what made it fun to do.
